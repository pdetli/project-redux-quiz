# Redux quiz group project

A multiple choised quiz developed with React Redux.

## The problem

- Used selectors to access redux state and dispatch to trigger redux actions.
- Used selectors and dispatches to interact with our Redux store
- There is an intro page to start the quiz.
- The summary page displays the users answers and the correct answers. The user can start the quiz again with a restart-button.
